# Introduction

This is a chrome extension which provides the following features:
- Fill in CRNs
- Submit CRNs automatically
- Refresh every 5 minutes to avoid session timeout (idea from Shawn)
- Auto refresh at an exact time
- Retry when page load time > 5s (not sure whether it works)

# Todo, or may never do

- Audo add to waitlist
- Disable the extension if ES6 support is not detected
- Check for update

# Remarks

- **Please read and understand the regulations and restrictions of ARRO**, and consider whether it's appropriate before you actually use it.
